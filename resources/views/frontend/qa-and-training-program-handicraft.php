            <p>The Handicraft industry in India has 744 handicraft clusters employing nearly 212,000 artisans and offering over 35,000 products. Dominated by female artisans, this sector is a promising prospect for Indiaâ€™s rural population. Thus, Samriddha Gram plans to minimize the shortcomings of this sector through skill upgradation via training of SHGs.</p>
