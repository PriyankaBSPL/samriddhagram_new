   <p>The Agro Entrepreneurship Training Program is a transformative initiative aimed at empowering individuals to become successful entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector. Through a structured curriculum and hands-on training, this program equips aspiring agripreneurs with the essential skills and knowledge required to navigate the complexities of modern agriculture. Participants learn about crop management, livestock husbandry, sustainable farming practices, and the intricacies of agribusiness management. Moreover, the program instills entrepreneurial acumen, teaching participants how to identify market opportunities, develop business plans, and access funding resources. By fostering a new generation of agro-entrepreneurs, this program not only contributes to economic growth in rural communities but also plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security, promoting sustainable farming practices, and harnessing innovation for the agricultural sector's continued development.</p>

          <p>The idea of Agro Entrepreneurship is essentially linked with the notion of inspiring the rural youth (particularly women) about entrepreneurial income possibilities. Thus, NRLM and DYMT have joined hands to support nationwide SHGs, FPOs, FPCs, and PGs for entrepreneurship. Their partnership opens gates to minutely detailed training sessions which could not have been possible earlier. Samriddha Grams’ guidance to rural people working or interested in FMCG, handloom, and handicraft sectors is a prime example of this union. From essential QA/QC training to financial and market networking, the vision to make successful rural entrepreneurs sustains through our efforts.</p>
          <p>The benefits of Agro Entrepreneurship:</p>
          <ul>
                <li>Prepares groundwork for short and long-term benefits to the rural economy</li>
<li>New possibilities for rural tourism </li>
<li>Develops stable and sustainable income opportunities</li>
<li>Instills a growth mindset and improves confidence in rural youth</li>
<li>Supports the government's ‘Doubling farmers income’ initiative</li>
            </ul>

               <p>After understanding the benefits, we must consider the complications faced by people in embracing agro entrepreneurship. Our nation’s culturally rich rural section is devoid of capital and proper logistical support. On top of that, the lack of Internet availability and unfamiliarity with the latest digital solutions is a huge compromise in growth. The rural population is also less skilled with severely low exposure to current QA/QC norms. Relatively inadequate knowledge about packaging, labeling, scientific storage, and value addition further barricades an enterprise’s progress.  </p>

<p>In this context, Samriddha Gram provides a 3-day basic and 5-day advanced training to farmers. This training is focused on educating participants through training modules prepared in regard to NSDC and NiMSME.

Samriddha Gram further helps participants by providing logistical support, warehousing possibilities, and post-training guidance essential for building industry relations. More notably, financial support is also being provided through Kisan Samriddhi and Vishwakarma Samridhhi Cards. </p>
        <p>Samriddha Grams’ approach to boosting the rural economy through local businesses will provide versatile income sources so people do not heavily depend only on agriculture and government-run projects.</p>
