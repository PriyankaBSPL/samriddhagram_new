    <p>The rural population’s expense in the FMCG sector is rapidly increasing. The growing comfort with food and non-food items can also be steered towards its production. Although people living in villages run micro-production businesses, they lack the concept of regulating their product’s quality to the highest standards.  Acknowledging this prospect, Samriddha Gram plans on providing essential Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) training to rural communities. </p>

The objective is to train the personnel who can be designated as food safety supervisors or who are engaged in food manufacturing units about food safety, hygiene requirements, and quality enhancements of their products. It would help rural communities to enhance their skills and deliver quality products. </p>

<p>The training will also help rural entrepreneurs keep a check on their production processes and achieve sustainable business. In essence, Samriddha Gram is helping rural entrepreneurs smoothen their QA/QC procedures so they could create world - class FMCG products. Although positive changes are time consuming yet consistent efforts will initiate long lasting changes and standardization of rural produced FMCG products. </p>
