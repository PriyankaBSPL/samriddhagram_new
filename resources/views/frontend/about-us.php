            <h2>WHY <br />SAMRIDDHA GRAM?</h2>
            <p>Divya Yog Mandir Trust, Patanjali, has always been working for social upliftment. For almost 30 years, it
              has helped countless people improve their socioeconomic conditions. The Government of India has
              subsequently acknowledged DYMâ€™s contribution to our society by making it NRO ( National Resource
              Organization) for NRLM.</p>

            <p>The NRO has undertaken multiple activities, both on a national and state level, striving to elevate the
              skill set of women SHGs, creating fresh livelihoods in rural areas by means of its capacity building and
              business expansion initiatives. It has developed an entire digital ecosystem with its one-stop business
              support solution, combined with its unique marketing strategy.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>NRLM has long been committed to enhancing the capabilities of women SHG communities by furnishing them
                with adequate resources in an advantageous

                environment. Despite the positive effect of NRLM's mentorship strategy, it is now looking for new ways
                to facilitate SHG access to rural markets.</li>
              <li>The NRO has taken the lead by launching the Samriddha Gram initiative, which has the goal of equipping
                rural communities with the resources they need to become successful entrepreneurs. This is an important
                moment for sustainable rural development, as rural entrepreneurship is quickly gaining traction.</li>
              <li>By utilizing a local-based strategy and digitizing the process, women SHG grants its members
                comprehensive guidance, particularly concerning product presentation and visibility. Samriddha Gram
                offers support for promoting their quality-assured products both on physical and digital outlets,
                allowing them to have greater visibility in more distant markets.</li>
