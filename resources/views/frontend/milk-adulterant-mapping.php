           <p>Samriddha Gram envisions minimizing milk adulteration across the nation. Being the top milk producer in the world, India also faces numerous constraints in milk production, procurement, processing, and delivery systems. The continuous increase in milk production also demands improved observance of the quality of milk consumed by our citizens. </p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 dkd-machine">
            <p>As per a report published by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), 34% of the total milk produced is sold to the unorganized sector, the organized sector accounts for only 20% of the total milk produced while the remaining 46% percent milk is consumed locally. This situation leaves loopholes that are exploited by people who put money over the innocent lives of billions. </p>
           <p>The major issues faced by dairy farmers in India are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of organized bodies</li>
<li>Lack of sufficient government support</li>
<li>Delay in payments</li>
<li>Low ruminant productivity</li>
<li>Lack of Awareness and Education</li>
<li>Low Literacy Levels</li>
            </ul>

<p>Thus, Samriddha Gram has devised a structure to save billions of people from adulterated milk through information and inspection. Using the ERP technology (Enterprise resource planning), dairy farmers will efficiently control numerous aspects preventing them from producing better quality milk.  </p>
<p>The benefits of using the Patanjali Dairy ERP Application are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improved efficiency</li>
<li>Inventory management</li>
<li>Production planning</li>
<li>Quality control</li>
<li>Financial management</li>
<li>Improved traceability</li>
    
</ul>

<p>Apart from the ERP, Samriddha Gram will provide practical and theoretical training to people. Samriddha Gram plans on undertaking multi-dimensional campaigns to spread awareness regarding identifying low-quality milk, adulteration of milk, and its negative impact on health. Furthermore, rural communities shall be enlightened about the norms set by national and international regulatory bodies. It will enhance their understanding of different adulterants like water, urea, hydrogen peroxide, formalin, or detergent. </p>   
<p>Apart from this, Samriddha Gram will train rural people to self-diagnose milk using physical and sensory checks along with a safe, simple, easy-to-use, portable, and cost-effective solution to detect specific adulterants. In this way, farmers will be able to check milkâ€™s safety and quality at the farm level. They would also be encouraged to work collaboratively against people involved in milk contamination. </p>
</div>
       <div class="col-lg-12 dkd-machine"> 
    <p>Following the detection, Samriddha Gram would coach dairy farmers to resolve adulteration-related issues. Secondly, people will be regularly updated about new adulteration methods and innovative ways to detect chemical presence in the milk. 
Let's conclude with some of the other major points of training:
</p>    
      <ul>
          <li>Livestock management</li>
<li>	Disease prevention and management</li>
<li>	Guidance on breeding and genetics</li>
<li>	Guidance on nutrition and feeding</li>
<li>	Healthcare and veterinary services</li>
<li>	Updates on market trends 
</li>
      </ul>
