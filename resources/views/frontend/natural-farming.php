            <p>Recognizing the vast possibilities of natural farming, Samriddha Gram envisions using it to make our soil pesticide-free. In the long run, it will not only produce the highest quality crops but also ensure agriculture sustainability. Although pesticides and fertilizers have helped farmers meet our nation’s increasing demand yet its continuous usage is bridging us towards a dead end. Once our soil becomes extremely polluted, we would not be able to steer back from complete anarchy. Therefore, natural farming cannot be seen as any less than an agriculture savior.  </div>

      <p>Moving forward, we will understand some major reasons for promoting Natural farming. </p>
<ul>
<li>It is 100% chemical free</li>
<li>It is an agroecology-based diversified farming system that integrates crops, trees, and livestock with functional biodiversity</li>
<li>It ensures better soil health, improved agro-biodiversity, and a more judicious usage of water with much smaller carbon and nitrogen footprints</li>
<li>It minimizes the cost of production and increases farmer’s income</li>
</ul>

 <p>As Samriddha Gram initiates natural farming training for women-led SHGs across India, it is focused on all-round practical education of participants. The SHGs are taught the concept of diversified cropping system-based agriculture which helps in greater returns from value-added crops and better conservation of natural resources. They are educated about soil preparation, sowing, irrigation, weeding, harvesting, and storage.
However, in the midst of excessive pesticide usage, it is not easy to convince farmers to embrace natural farming. They understand how bad pesticide usage can be for the soil and the whole environment but their attachment to current incentives and outcomes outweighs education.

<p>Thus, Samriddha Gram provides endless support to small land farmers on multiple parameters through its systematic training structure. </p>
<p>The training can be structured into three parts:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-training -</strong> It involves sourcing trainers and establishing the necessary framework to train participants. 
<p><strong>During training - </strong>It involves on field training of participants through necessary kits guidance and assessment from trainers. 
<p><strong>Post-training - </strong>It involves supporting farmers by providing organic products, necessary inputs and connecting them with the market.

                  <div class="row align-items-center" style="margin-top:20px;">
  <p>Moreover, farmers are trained to use the DKD kit and DKD machine too. It helps them identify their soil profile and determine the pesticide toxicity in their farming land. 
We are determined to undertake regular field visits and assist farmers in updating their natural farming methods continuously. Samriddha Gram will also establish Farm Labs spread across 1 acre to demonstrate the methodologies and principles of natural farming. 
</p>
<p>In the process of empowering our farmers, introduction of natural farming will be a mainstay project for Samriddha Gram. We are determined to revitalize our agrarian economy without burdening the soil with pesticides. Sooner than later, farmers will adopt natural farming for better yield, improved income, and less stress on our environment.  </p>
