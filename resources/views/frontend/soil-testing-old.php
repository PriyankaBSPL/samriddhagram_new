<h2>Soil testing </h2>
<p>Soil testing is an essential element of modern farming, allowing farmers to gain insight into their soil's makeup and nutritional elements. By analyzing the soil, farmers can make informed decisions regarding fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs needed for optimal crop growth. Samriddha Gram offers "Dharti Ka Doctor, " a" comprehensive soil health management system. The training programs are designed to enhance farmers' understanding of soil health. During the training sessions, participants learn various techniques for soil sampling, sample collection, and laboratory analysis. They learn about different crops' nutrient requirements, ultimately benefiting their harvest.</p>

         <p>Soil testing also contributes to sustainable farming by reducing excessive use of inputs, conserving resources, and promoting healthier ecosystems. As a fundamental tool for maximizing agricultural productivity, soil testing is a cornerstone of responsible land use. Due to our efforts, data-driven decisions are eventually helping farmers benefit through better crop yield and savings. Their empowerment is a foundation for future generations to be positively inclined toward agriculture.  </p>
       <p>In addition to the previously stated benefits of "Dharti ka Doctor", we must also acknowledge its contribution to fostering self-reliance within the farming community. They can test soil at their will at any time they wish instead of looking for help or assuming the productivity of their soil. </p>
