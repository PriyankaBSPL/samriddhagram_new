    <p>Rural businesses are in urgent need to upgrade. They need to resolve several issues hampering their expansion. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural businesses rely heavily on manual data keeping which has its limitations. In order to grow, they must digitize their operations. Sooner or later, every rural enterprise would have to use technology for streamlining their operations. However, the shift from manual records to automation should happen smoothly instead of forceful acceptance. </p> 
   <p>This transition needs to be orchestrated in ways suitable for our rural population. Samriddha Gram in association with Bharuwa Solutions Pvt. Ltd. has planned to initiate this necessary change. The NRO has curated a systemized solution for rural entrepreneurs and customers from production to end sales and beyond. The process can be divided into three stages described below. </p>
