     <p>One of the many roadblocks for rural enterprises has been stock’s mismanagement. The word “Stock Inventory” includes all the finished goods ready for sale. Thus, stock inventory’s management becomes a continuously changing complicated task which needs precise supervision. Unfortunately, the majority of rural sellers are unable to board every minute detail of their stock’s movement. </p>

      <p>Some of the major issues faced by rural entrepreneurs are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate stock visibility  </li>
 <li>No or insufficient management software  </li>
 <li>Issues in tracking defected and waste inventory  </li>
 <li>Lousy order management  </li>
 <li>Poor communication  </li>
 <li>Overstocking </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The above-mentioned issues arise for one single loophole - Traditional manual inventory management systems. Due to recurring errors and lengthy processes they often lead to losses. This situation negatively impacts a seller’s reputation, gradually diminishing its value.   </p>

<p>Samriddha Gram envisions resolving these issues with help from the technical giant of Patanjali - Bharuwa Solutions Pvt. Ltd. B-POS (Bharuwa-Point of Sale) is an Enterprise Resource Planning system which aids businesses precisely track stock movements, get real-time updates on inventory visibility and make data driven decisions. From resource allocation to end sales B-POS helps businesses keep up with every aspect of their daily activities. Reduced waste, improved flexibility, minimized costs, greater efficiency and better goodwill are some of the short-term benefits of using B-POS. </p> 
<p>However, rural entrepreneurs are closely connected to their traditional practices. We plan on educating them about the use and perks of a digitized stock inventory system.  Although, we cannot expect overnight change yet gradual empowerment will lead to positive transformation.</p>
