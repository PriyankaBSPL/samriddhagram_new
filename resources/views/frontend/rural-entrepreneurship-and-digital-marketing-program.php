       <p>More than 60% of the population in India resides in rural areas. Full of untapped potential, this population seeks support for its upliftment. Currently, the majority of people from villages are completely dependent on agriculture which cuts down on a lot of business possibilities. Although villagers are naturally inclined towards entrepreneurship yet they are not able to comprehend the complexities of running an enterprise. Moreover, they face added difficulties in production and trade due to the tremendous change in technology over the recent years. Samriddha Gram, understanding the urgency for change, plans on enlightening villagers about entrepreneurship.</p>

               <p>To assist the rural population in embracing entrepreneurship, Samriddha Gram conducts nationwide training programs. Within these educational coaching sessions, participants are exposed to the many benefits of running a self-owned enterprise. The team also provides extensive information on the procedures and tools necessary to initiate a new business. Furthermore, new and upcoming entrepreneurs are given valuable mentorship so they could dodge some of the obvious roadblocks while connecting them with the local markets. </p>
<p>Samriddha Gram also provides working knowledge to use the PI Live, B-POS and B-Order software. This technological help allows people to effectively manage their businesses beginning from production to the end sales of their product. Complementing these efforts, our support system makes sure people are able to use the training in ways best for their enterprise.  </p>
<p>In the same way, participants are extensively educated about digital marketing. It assists them to reach potential customers at a marginal cost compared to traditional marketing. Our team helps entrepreneurs communicate through best digital platforms for local as well as global advertising. The guidance improves the salability of products as well as strengthens long term customer relationships. </p>
<p>Samriddha Gram, through its efforts, is trying to give rural youth a firm reason to become economically stable. In the wake of time, our villagers will experience tremendous revenue streams eventually putting an end to migration. </p>
