       <p>Samridhha Gram aims to revolutionize animal husbandry by adopting a sustainable approach rooted in our traditional cow rearing process, known as the Gaushala model. This carefully crafted model not only ensures sustainability but also provides a decent source of livelihood. </p>

         <p>At the core of our approach are two pillars: community engagement and support, and income diversification. We believe that by actively involving the community and providing them with the necessary support, we can create a thriving ecosystem. Additionally, diversifying income sources is crucial to ensure stability and growth.
Our model revolves around two main activities: Panchgavya Research and Development, and Livelihood Promotion. Panchgavya, a powerful on-farm input for organic farming, is composed of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd, jaggery, ghee, banana, tender coconut, and water. This super nutrient contains all the essential macro and micro nutrients, growth hormones, and more, making it highly effective for organic farming.

               <p>Livelihood promotion, on the other hand, focuses on income diversification. We encourage activities such as organic farming and crop cultivation, milk production and sales, biogas production, vermicomposting, sustainable water management, collaboration and networking, efficient resource management, as well as financial planning and accountability. Additionally, Patanjali has always promoted indigenous breeds of cows in its modern cow shelters and under the Gau Sanwardhan it follows safe methods to improve cow breeds and supports breed selection, semen selection, embryo transplantation, etc. Some of the developed cow varieties are capable of giving 50-60 L of milk. Some of our renowned products include the Godhan Ark (cow urine based ayurvedic products), and Gonyle disinfectant (high quality antimicrobial floor cleaner), etc. </p>
