     <p>The Ayurveda and Primary Health Care Training Program is a crucial initiative that seeks to bridge the gap between traditional wisdom and modern healthcare. Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine originating from India, emphasizes holistic wellness and natural remedies. This program equips people with the knowledge and skills needed to integrate Ayurvedic principles into primary health care practices. Participants learn about herbal medicine, dietary guidelines, meditation, and yoga, all of which play a vital role in preventive and holistic healthcare. By blending Ayurveda with conventional medicine, this training program aims to offer more comprehensive and patient-centered care, addressing not only the physical symptoms but also the mental and emotional aspects of health. It embodies a paradigm shift towards a more holistic and personalized approach to healthcare, empowering both patients and healthcare providers to embrace a well-rounded path to wellness.</p>

        <p>Samriddha Gram understands rural India’s close relationship with Ayurveda. Our villages have been advocates of Ayurveda’s legacy for decades. Their interdependence doesn’t need to be exaggerated yet with time rural communities have lost touch with Ayurveda. On the other hand, primary healthcare has been one of the most challenging aspects of rural growth. Irrespective of the underlying reasons, the rural population deserves excellent health care services and holistic healing through Ayurveda. </p>
            <p>It is worth noting that the rural population’s reach to primary health care can be positively impacted through Ayurveda. Being close to nature, people living in Indian villages can grow medicinal plants through Samriddha Gram’s training and heal their community with the understanding of using them through Ayurveda. It can potentially transform the way the rural sector interacts with primary healthcare. Its expertise in providing world-class healing services and inspiring people to live a healthy lifestyle is unparalleled. </p>

               <p>The training program is devoid of any training fee and those interested in learning Ayurveda can register with Samriddha Gram. Being approved by NRLM and NSDC, the training and capacity-building exercises would extensively help participants understand the essence of Ayurveda’s role in primary health care. The training program is focused on improving the skills of Aushadhi Sakhi and Yoga Sakhi so they can impart Ayurveda’s knowledge to others. </p>
<p>Ayurveda’s combination with Yoga is universally practiced. Thus, Samriddha Gram will provide Yoga certification courses to participants so their healing efficiency doubles. Furthermore, a Master trainer and Training trainer program has been planned to enhance the skills of Yoga practitioners in the long run. </p>
<p>It can also be argued that Yoga and Ayurveda’s application in primary health care can be tricky. People have become comfortable with Allopathy and natural healing might become a secondary option for them. However, Samriddha Gram is fully aware of these obstacles and plans to incorporate Yoga and Ayurveda into the everyday life of rural people. This long and exhaustive process will internally heal people and the need to use chemical-based medicines will gradually decline resulting in a healthier rural population. </p>
