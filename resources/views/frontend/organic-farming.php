          <p>Samridhha Gram’s vision to empower organic farming across India comes from the need to revolutionize our farming sector. It's well known that pesticides have hampered soil health and the final crop quality. Their excessive and unmonitored use coupled with bad agricultural practices has led us into a trap of quantity over quality. However, we can still reverse these harmful effects so our soil health can gradually improve to its best potential. Thus, we are involved in promoting organic production, postharvest management, farmer certification, value addition, and collective marketing of organic products. </p>

      <p>To understand more about our work, we would have to acknowledge the reasons for chemical farming and the issues that come with organic farming. Our farmers are under constant pressure to feed the demands of billions of citizens. More production demands more input requirements which forces them to use unchecked levels of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. It eventually enters our ecology harming the overall environment. Although Organic farming is a concrete solution yet some of the roadblocks refraining farmers are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of awareness among farmers </li>
<li>Inadequate infrastructure </li>
<li>Marketing constraints </li>
<li>Lesser yield </li>
<li>Shorter life span of harvest</li> 
<li>Time consumption </li>
<li>Limited choice in crop production </li>
<li>Higher input costs </li>
<li>More risk of damage from pests</li>
<li>Problematic certification process</li>
<li>Higher MRP </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we focus on the use of technology to help farmers. Our team educates farmers about using the DKD kit so they could self-analyze their soil. It helps them determine the toxicity levels of their soil and the necessary steps to get rid of pesticide residuals. Use of the DKD kit leaves no room to guess a farm’s productive capacity which enables farmers to effectively use their land. </p>
      
      <p>In the post training programs, we connect with farmers in offline and online modes answering their concerns and updating them about best possible organic farming practices. Samriddha Gram also conducts regular farm surveys to ensure farmers correctly use our training for their benefits.  </p>
