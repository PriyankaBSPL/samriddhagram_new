<h2>Quality Assurance and Quality Control </h2>
<p>QA and QC training in Samriddha Vikas focuses on educating project managers, program staff and community leaders for better results of livelihood initiatives. It encourages participants to maintain predetermined standards necessary to deliver sustainable outcomes.</p> 
<p>During the training, they learn about quality standards, the development of monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and the implementation of regular audits. By integrating QA and QC practices into their work, Samriddha Gram aims to achieve lasting positive change in the lives of rural communities. Again, it is crucial to understand that only proper guidance can ensure excellent results from SHGs, even in critical times. It is inevitable to hit roadblocks, yet information and training are the saviors of every organization. </p>
<p>Samriddha Gram identifies the need to create a systematic approach to rural prosperity. It understands the need to equip people with the correct information and create informed leaders. Rural India is full of possibilities that can only be harnessed by the capable members of its community. Our QA and QC training instills a sense of responsibility among people so they repeatedly achieve desired results. It exposes them to the best practices in committing to the quality of their produce. These efforts are predecessors to the foundational growth of rural development. </p>
