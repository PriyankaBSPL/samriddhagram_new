   <p>With an increasing emphasis on natural remedies and wellness, the cultivation of medicinal plants has gained significant momentum. Farmers and growers are dedicating their efforts to sustainably cultivate a wide array of plants with therapeutic properties, such as ashwagandha, rose periwinkle and ginseng, among many others. As the demand for herbal remedies continues to rise, effective marketing strategies have also evolved. Medicinal plant cultivators now connect with potential consumers through various channels, including online platforms, health food stores, and farmers' markets, emphasizing the importance of organic and ethically sourced products. This convergence of cultivation and marketing not only promotes the use of natural remedies but also offers economic opportunities to communities and contributes to the conservation of valuable plant species, ensuring a healthier and more sustainable future for both individuals and the environment.</p>

        <h2>How do we help? </h2>
         <p>Samriddha Gram provides expert assistance from the elite research scientists of Patanjali. We will be educating farmers about the various aspects of plant identification, collection, processing, and further quality assurance tests at the lab level. Apart from training farmers about the cultivation of medicinal plants assistance will be provided to them in selling their harvest at the best possible prices. The training team will also facilitate sales through buy-back programs. </p>
    <p>Likewise, Samriddha Gram is providing extensive training on essential QA/QC practices which drastically improves the quality of harvest. It also helps farmers to pre-determine a quality standard for their medicinal crops which impacts the efficiency of every on and off-field operation. To boost the harvest’s tradability our team of scientists conducts lab tests on crops certifying their authenticity. This process imparts confidence and also authenticates the hard work done by farmers. </p>

<h4><strong>Now, let us explore the direct benefits to farmers through medicinal plant cultivation. </strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Higher return on investments in comparison to regular crops. </li>
<li>Year-round demand for medicinal crops instead of seasonal demand experienced in staple crops.  </li>
<li>Increased soil fertility due to crop diversification. </li>
<li>Possibilities of international exports due to high demand for medicinal plant products. </li>
<li>Reduced dependency on climatic conditions and on-farm inputs. </li>
<li>Improved possibilities of eco-tourism.  </li>
</ul>
   <p>Moreover, we have forged close associations with several SRLMs, and government training institutes like NiMSME (Hyderabad) and SIAET (Bhopal), where we plan on providing extensive training sessions and certifications. This process coupled with guidance to community resource persons (CRPs) and SHG members from invited SRLM frames the groundwork for large-scale medicinal plant farming.  Samriddha Gram’s association with NSDC further boosts its efforts to impart training at the national level. It has also maintained CRM (Consumer Resource Management) services to answer queries and gather training feedback. All things considered, medicinal plant farming is a highly beneficial option for farmers and its successful implementation can heal India’s agrarian economy. </p>
