<h2>FOOD & DAIRY</h2>

Through its inclusive approach, Samriddha Gram uplifts the rural economy via local entrepreneurship.</p> 
<p>Dairy farming is a significant and integral part of rural life in India. It has a long history and plays a vital role in the livelihoods of millions of people in rural areas. Subsequently, it serves as a reliable source of income for many rural families and a crucial contribution to the local economy. Samriddha Gram aims to conserve traditional dairy farming methods while modernizing daily practices with superior management techniques. It also seeks to ensure a stable market for farmers to initiate the continuous flow of revenue for them. </p>
