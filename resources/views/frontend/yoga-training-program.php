          <p>As part of its comprehensive approach to boosting skill development, Samriddha Gram has included yoga training programs to create new income-generating opportunities for rural people. The mission aims to enhance the income potential of the rural population while addressing their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Besides yoga asanas (postures), participants also get comfortable with meditation practices. Integrating yoga training within the program demonstrates a complete approach to rural development. Focusing not only on income generation but also on the overall personality development of individuals, it acknowledges the fusion of physical, mental, and economic aspects of life. Through Yoga, Samriddha Gram aims to train people to become productive members of our society while healing their community.</p>

            <p>Yoga finds its origins deeply rooted in India's cultural and philosophical heritage. Its history spanning thousands of years has evolved into a holistic system encompassing physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), meditation, and ethical principles. It is an accessible tool for promoting health and mindfulness in daily life. Moreover, Yoga has been an essential part of India's rural culture, a community practice in various villages. With a strong connection with nature, people in Indian villages are comfortable embracing Yoga for their socio-economic upliftment.</p>
        <p>Under the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) flagship program DAY NRLM, Samriddha Gram works as an NRO working to uplift the rural population. Apart from all the technology and science-based activities it also dwells in the corridor of Yogic practices. It plans to execute extensive training on Yoga through Aushadhi Sakhi. The training aims to educate women-led SHGs in the numerous aspects of Yoga and meditation. The up-skilling has a compound impact as it not only helps people heal but also provides them with an income source. </p>

<p>Within the training, participants will be enlightened about āsana (Postures), Prānāyāma (Breathing exercises), Dhāraṇā (Concentration) and Dhyāna (Meditation). They would also be introduced to Yogic texts to establish a firm consciousness about the history, vision, and possibilities of Yoga. Interested participants will have a chance to continue diploma and degree courses apart from the basic (five days) and advanced (seven days) training programs. </p>
        <p>The aim and objectives of the training are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educating rural communities about self-healing</li>
<li>Motivating them to practice mental hygiene</li>
<li>Helping them achieve emotional stability</li>
<li>Inspiring them to adopt moral values</li>
<li>Creating livelihood opportunities for rural communities by ensuring income generation through skilled manpower</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The multidimensional Yoga training program is not limited to teaching. It ensures that participants receive income opportunities too. After the completion of the training session, a certified trainer (recognized by the Yoga certification board, NRLM, and NSDC) can become a Yoga therapist, a researcher, or practice and teach Yoga on an individual level. They will have promising work choices in Yoga teaching organizations, gyms, schools, resorts, health centers, and housing societies.  </p>
        <p>To summarize our efforts, we would share the long-term prospect of Yoga training. Rural India has been troubled by health concerns for a long time now. Irrespective of efforts from the government we are far away from the idea of a healthy community. Yoga, being free and comparatively effortless, is an efficient channel to focus our energy on self-healing. If our rural community embraces Yoga in their lifestyle, their dependency on medical help will drastically decrease as they become self-reliant healers.</p>
