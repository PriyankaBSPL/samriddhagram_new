               <p>Millet production in India has come a long way. From humble beginnings in the Indus valley civilization to becoming the largest millet producers we have preserved millets in our cultural and economic development. However, we still haven’t realized their true potential. Millets are super healthy low maintenance crops which seek better presentation and promotion.   </p>
           <p>Samriddha Gram plans to harness this potential through a systematic approach that directly boosts India's millet production magnitude. It will not only provide superior nutrition alternatives to health seekers but also improve the financial perspective of the rural population. Thus, the Millets Training Program is focused on encouraging and training farmers, FPOs, SHGs, and other related groups to adopt better methods of millet cultivation. This initiative will focus on tribals who have been cultivating millets so their hard work could produce better income and sustainability. They would also be provided with better seeds, market connections, and a robust distribution system. Gradually, better profit would inspire tribals to continue millet farming on a larger scale averting the declining production of these crops. </p>

            <p>Our vision doesn't end here. We want to restructure the entire millet production system as the millet economy seeks complete rejuvenation. Some of our major goals are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide knowledge and skills to individuals or groups involved in millet cultivation, production, and processing.</li>
<li>Value Addition to Millets with safety regulations.</li>
<li>Effective business planning & branding and marketing.</li>
<li>To aware individuals or groups about the initiatives and schemes launched and implemented by state and central governments for the promotion of millet production.</li>
<li>To provide an understanding of business opportunities in millets.</li>
            </ul>

           <div class="row align-items-center" style="margin-top:20px;">

 <p>In regard to these goals, Samiddha Gram organizes comprehensive training sessions. These sessions will educate participants about the theory and practicality of millet cultivation practices, millet processing practices, millet recipes, and Government projects on millet production. Furthermore, participants also understand the intuitive yet logical art of marketing millets including their branding, packaging, and labeling. The training sessions educate farmers about self-soil testing through the DKD (Dharti Ka Doctor) kit and machine. They include field experiments, case studies of successful millet production stories, use of mobile applications in diagnosing soil health and marketing.   </p>

<p>After the initial training: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Samriddha Gram will conduct continuous monitoring and evaluation of the farmers. </li>
<li>They would be provided with financial help so they sustain the inputs and machinery necessary for millet production. </li>
<li>Farmers will be connected with the correct buyers, processors, and retailers. </li>
<li>They would be guided to establish small-scale processing units for millet-based products like flour, porridge mixes, snacks, and beverages.</li>
<li>Our team will organize awareness programs regularly at regional levels so farmers stay up to date with changes in the millet economy. </li>
<li>Farmers would receive continuous technical support from our team. </li>
<li>Collective millet producer’s groups will be formed so farmers help each other’s progress. </li>
    
</ul>

<p>Samriddha Gram’s efforts to modernize the Indian millet farming sector are an essential part of its aim to uplift the rural population’s socio-economic conditions. With time, our activities will increase and its outcome will be communicated on the website. </p>
